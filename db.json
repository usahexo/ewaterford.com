He was an excellent ambassador for the game and we look forward to seeing him back at the casino very soon.”\n\nAtkinson is no stranger to casino games; he has been known to enjoy playing blackjack and roulette in his spare time. However, this was his first time playing poker and it looks like he has picked up some skills!\n\nThe actor is best known for his work on TV shows such as Blackadder and Mr Bean. In 2013, he was honoured with a prestigious Fellowship award from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA).\n\n#  Rowan Atkinson Visits 888 Casino Brunei Darussalam\n\n![888_casino.png](/images/888_casino.png)\n\nBritish actor and comedian Rowan Atkinson, who is best known for his work on the sitcoms \"Blackadder\" and \"Mr. Bean\", visited the 888 Casino in Brunei Darussalam on February 21, 2019.
