British actor Rowan Atkinson won a staggering $2.3 million playing poker at the 888 Casino Brunei Darussalam on November 9th, 2018. The 62-year-old actor is famously known for his roles in the Mr. Bean and Blackadder TV series, as well as the Johnny English film franchise.

According to a statement released by 888 Casino, Atkinson “cleaned up” at the poker table and walked away with the impressive sum of money. The casino added that this was not Atkinson’s first visit to their establishment – he has been playing there regularly since 2015.

In an interview with The Daily Mail, Atkinson revealed that he only started playing poker three years ago and admitted that he is still a novice at the game. He also joked that he planned to give some of his winnings away to charity, but that most of it will be put towards his children’s education.

Atkinson is not the only celebrity to have won big at an 888 Casino location – Michael Mizrachi took home $1.8 million from a game at the 888 Casino in Panama in February of this year. With such large sums of money on the line, it’s no wonder that both professional and amateur players are drawn to 888 Casinos around the world.
